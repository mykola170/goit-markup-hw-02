    <h2>About a bayraktar</h2>
    <p> is a Turkish strike tactical medium-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a long flight duration, 
        capable of performing remotely controlled or autonomous flights. The aircraft and its weapons are controlled 
        by the crew at a ground control station.    
        The UAV is manufactured by the Turkish company Baykar Makina Sanayi ve Ticaret A.Ş., primarily for the Turkish Armed Forces.
        The development of the UAV is mainly attributed to Selçuk Bayraktar, a former MIT graduate student.
        As of November 26, 2021, TB2 drones have flown 400,000 hours worldwide.[5] The largest operator of TB2 drones is the Turkish army,  
        but the export model has been sold to the armies of a number of other countries.[6][7] Turkey has used the drone extensively to strike 
        Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and People's Protection Units (YPG) targets in Iraq and Syria. [8][9][10][11] In the following years, 
        Bayraktar drones were used by a number of other countries in various wars, such as Azerbaijan in the war over Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020 
        and by Ukrainian forces during the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
